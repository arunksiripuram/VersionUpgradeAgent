# .NET Code Upgrade Agent

This .NET Code Upgrade Agent leverages LLM (Language Learning Model) capabilities to automate the process of upgrading .NET solutions and projects. Specifically, it is designed to migrate .NET Core projects to the latest .NET version (e.g., .NET 8), update NuGet packages to the latest stable versions, analyze code for vulnerabilities, suggest efficiency improvements, and identify deprecated methods. Additionally, it builds the solution and captures warnings and errors, saving them in a structured recommendations file.

## Features

- **Automatic .NET Version Upgrade**: Upgrades `.csproj` files to the latest .NET version (e.g., from `.NET Core 6` to `.NET 8`).
- **NuGet Package Update**: Detects outdated NuGet packages and upgrades them to the latest stable versions.
- **Dockerfile Update**: Updates Docker base images (e.g., `sdk` and `aspnet` images) to the latest .NET version in the Dockerfile.
- **Vulnerability Analysis**: Uses OpenAI to analyze code for potential vulnerabilities and provides mitigation suggestions.
- **Efficiency Recommendations**: Suggests code improvements for better efficiency and performance.
- **Build Solution and Capture Warnings**: Builds the upgraded solution, listing all warnings and errors in the process.
- **Generate Migration Report**: Saves all recommendations, warnings, and upgrade details in a structured text file for future reference.
